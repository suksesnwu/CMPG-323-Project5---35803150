## General Info
### Connected Office Initiative (COI)
***
The Connected Office Initiative (COI) encapsulates the use of IoT devices within the network, placed all over the office building, to collect and share the data that these devices gather.

This is a report built in Power BI, that will help all stakholders see the same information pertaining to the status of IoT device registrations on various platforms. 

## Quick start
The report can be accessed on this link: <a href="https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/3e49136a-d7ad-4e42-85b0-e17b423ea022/ReportSection7c1a104924a1005b0458">Report</a>

### High-Level Metrics
***
This a summary view that shows business stakeholders a high-level view of the ‘important’ data.

#### Count of Device Name
- A visual that shows counts of devices 

#### Count of Zones
- A visual that shows counts of zones 

#### Count of Categories
- A visual that shows counts of categories 

### Device Monitoring
***

#### Chart - Count of Device Name by Category
- A visual that allows the user to monitor devices per category 

#### Chart - Count of Device Name by Zone
- A visual that allows the user to monitor devices per zone 

#### Chart - Count of Device Name by Status (Online or Offline)

### Device Registration
***

#### Chart - Count of Device Name by Date Installed
- A visual that allows the user to see how many devices have been registered over a timespan 

#### Chart - Count of Category by Device Name
- A visual that allows the user to see how many categories of devices have been created 

#### Chart - Count of Device Name by Status (Online or Offline)

### Filtering
***
- Make use of filters that can be applied across pages and visuals 
- A filter for users to filter the report based on device category 
- A filter for users to filter the report based on device platform 
- A filter for users to filter the report based on device zone 
- A filter for users to filter the report based on device registration date 

### Stretch Tasks
***
- Added filtering with month, quarter and year for High-Level Metrics
